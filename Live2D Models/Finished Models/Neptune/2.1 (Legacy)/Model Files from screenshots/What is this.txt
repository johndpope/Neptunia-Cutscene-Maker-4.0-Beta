The original Neptune model included in this version as well as previous versions was created by photoshopping out the 
background from the actual games. The files included in this folder are the various assets used to create the model.
The reason I feel the need to mention this is because a few days after finishing this file we found a download for the
actual in game assets for the games (which I included in this file under /...). This is important since should you chose
to modify the model you may run into some issues since the assets here were taken from screenshots and the game engine
generally distorts the assets to give the illusion of motion. The screenshots were taken from Megadimension Neptunia VII
so if you do want to modify the model your best bet is to include character models from there
