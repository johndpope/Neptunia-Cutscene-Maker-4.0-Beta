Edit 6/28/2018 (Version 4.0b)
Many aspects of this tutorial are likely outdated thanks to the inclusion of the updated Text Scroll program. I will
update this tutorial in the near future to reflect the current process).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Steps for Image:

Note: Steps 1-5 are just initial setup. Once those steps are done you can go straight to step 6
1- Download "assets" zip and 2.1.0 zip
2- Unzip files
3- If you dont plan to make videos then you may delete the following:
	- Sony Vegas Template Folder
	- Music and Sound Effects
	- In the Character Model Cubism Files:
		- Facerig Files
		- Finished Models
		- Important Downloads
4- Download the following programs: Photoshop (or a free alternative. Paint.net is fine for basic stuff), Gamemaker 1 or 2

Differences between Gamemaker 1 and 2:
Gamemaker 1- Free, really annoying to make games (since this is a template this doesnt affect you. interface is bad though)
Gamemaker 2- $60, real easy to make games

There is a way around using gamemaker if you want but it makes it look slightly less accurate to the games (see below)


5- In the main folder there is a file named "Neptunia Text Font (REQUIRED!!!).otf. This is a download for the font
used in RB1 (aktiv grotesk). This is not a default windows font so you have to download it. You can use another
font but it wont look as real. In order to download it simply double click it. Windows will give you a warning
which is normal and you can ignore (Fonts are saved in the System 32 and any changes to system 32 trip the security.
The reason for this is because hackers often use fake downloads of legit programs to gain access to the system and
bypass security through vulnerabilities). The computer may ask you to restart.


Once steps 1-5 are done you are ready to make cutscenes. There are 2 ways to do this: You can either use Gamemaker to prerender
the text properly and greenscreen it in or you can manually add it in in photoshop.


Steps 6-10 are only required if you are using Gamemaker. It makes the overall image look more accurate if you do it right but takes a few extra minutes
and requires photoshop and knowlege of greenscreening in photoshop

Additional Steps With Gamemaker (it seems complicated but its SUPER easy once u get used to it)

6- With Gamemaker 1 or 2 downloaded and installed navigate to the folder marked "Gamemaker" and open the template file (gm1: .gmx, gm2: .yyp).
7- With that opened navigate to the Fonts tab, click the dropdown for select font, and click aktiv grotesk (Only required to do once)
8- Navigate to the objects tab and under obj_spawner click the step event. In the step event on line 6 it says "str = "x";. Change that x
to whatever you want it to say. keep in mind you need to put a # to skip lines manually.
9- in Gamemaker 2 you can preview the text in the actual textbox by pressing right arrowkey. In Gamemaker 1 i dont believe that is currently
supported thus there should be a little text thing that looks something like this and u just have to make sure ur text doesnt go past the dashes

---------------------
10- Run the code and click anywhere in the box for the text to start scrolling. Once its at the end use a screen recorder to screenshot the screen.
MAKE SURE TO SCREENSHOT IT WITH THE GREEN BACKGROUND WITHOUT THE TEXT BOX IF U ARE USING GAMEMAKER 2!!! Make sure your screenshot is 1920x400
since it makes things MUCH faster and easier. Also make sure to save it as a PNG and the highest quality possible to avoid minor issues
===========================================================================================================================================================

11- Once you screenshot the text open Photoshop and set up your scene
12- To set up your scene select a background from the backgrounds folder. The backgrounds are separated by game. Also the backgrounds for VII are modular
meaning u can change the sky box texture to make the scene either night or day for many backgrounds. Set the background in the back-most layer
13- Next add in the character model. You can either google them or you can construct them using the assets found under /2.1.0/character model cubism files/original game models(unedited)/
Models are divided up by game. Its pretty much like a puzzle, put the pieces together and walla. doing this allows for a limitless amount of emotions, character combinations,
you can even combine aspects of different characters to make something unique. Keep in mind btw that the models from VII are more complex than RB1-RB3 so if u are
not good at photoshops stick with those. Update 2.1.1 (coming in 1-3 weeks) will add in some basic plug-n-play models for easier use but for now you must construct the model yourself
14- Resize the character model and set it in the layer above the background.
15- navigate to the folder marked "text box files" and drag and drop the file marked "dialog box no name.png". Place this above the character character model layer
16- There are a few default names in the text box files folder but if the one you want isnt there then open the "text box name area" file and add in a name. Place this above the dialog box
17- you may use the "dialog box no arrow test.png" file as a guide for where the dialog box goes

(if you are using Gamemaker)18- Paste in the screenshot of the text, line up the bottom row of pixels, and greenscreen it

(if you are not using Gamemaker) 19- Write the text in the text box using the correct font. You will have to play with the sizing, positioning, etc. to get it right
which is why i recommend using Gamemaker instead but this is faster
