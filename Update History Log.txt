Version 2.1.1B (Emergency bug fix!!!)
Status: Public
Release Date: October 17th 2017

There is an issue with the installer included to get Gamemaker 1. The installer itself works however you
need a license in order to use it. This emergency update fixes that by adding a text file explaining how
to work around that by getting the steam version of the program. In addition to that the steam version
can only read .project.gmx files and the file had a few bugs all of which were fixed

Version 3.0
Status: Complete, not public

Major changes:
- Switch from using Live2D models to original in-game models using a modding tool.

Notes: This version was not released public because the previous version already contained the
same modding tool used to obtain the original in-game models. Because of this even though the overall
process for making the cutscenes changed which justified calling it version 3.0, nothing was actually 
added. I was considering making a catalog of all the character model animations so you don't need
to rip the models yourself however due to technical difficulties, time constraints, and file size
limitations when sharing the file, the decision was made to scrap this idea.
